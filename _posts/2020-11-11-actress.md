melancholic melodies on top of severely filtered kicks and vague ambient sounds make you feel like you've been left on a street outside of the fun party

the sound of the album is influenced by modern uk bass, but its tempo, atmosphere and overall feeling is clearly trip-hop

top tracks: Leaves Against The Sky, Walking Flames
