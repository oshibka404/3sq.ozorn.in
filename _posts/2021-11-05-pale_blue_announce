In just a week, On November 12, my new single "Pale Blue" is to be released. 

Pale blue is the colour of the sea on a cloudy day and the colour of our planet seen from afar, the best color to represent feeling of this introspective house track where melancholy blends with euphory producing a deeply reflective tech house composition, equally meditative and danceable.
In this release I am moving away from the rhythmic experiments of [EP1](/ep1) to the comfortable straight 4/4 beat, and paying more attention to sound timbre. The result is a tech house with a subtle tape-like texture.

The single is [available for presave](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/threecoloredsquares/pale-blue-2).
