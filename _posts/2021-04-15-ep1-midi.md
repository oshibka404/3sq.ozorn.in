Let's learn from each other and share what we can.

A week after I released [EP1](/ep1) on all streaming services and Bandcamp, I want to share all MIDI tracks of this album: 
everything you need to reproduce the music. If you need my presets, feel free to contact me and I'll share them, 
but it will be much more fun if you try to create your own sound using free software synthesizer.
I recommend [Vital](https://vital.audio/), [TAL Noisemaker](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-noisemaker) or [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/).
Any DAW will work for you.

[Download MIDI tracks of EP1](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/kEJ8iRYTnS1VSQ). In the archive you'll find instructions and license information in two languages: English and Russian.

Please, share with me everything you do using these files. You don't have to, but I would be very interested and will help you with sharing as much as I can.
