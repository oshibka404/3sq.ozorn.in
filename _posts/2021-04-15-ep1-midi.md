Let's learn from each other and share what we can.

A week after I released [EP1](/ep1) on all streaming services and Bandcamp, I want to share all MIDI tracks of this album: 
everything you need to reproduce the music. If you need my presets, feel free to contact me and I'll share them, 
but it will be much more fun if you try to create your own sound using free software synthesizer.
I recommend [Vital](https://vital.audio/), [TAL Noisemaker](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-noisemaker) or [Helm](https://tytel.org/helm/).
Any DAW will work for you.
