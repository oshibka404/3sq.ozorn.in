Rob Pringle from a pretty cool British publication Plastic Mag [has reviewed](https://plasticmag.co.uk/2021/03/16/downtempo-from-three-colored-squares/) my latest track "The Walk in Falling Leaves".

Here's what they say:

_The artist never hides musical ideas behind complex soundscapes. Instead, he expresses them as clearly as possible and then removes everything else, making “naive electronica of straight lines and bright colours”._

_He draws influence from IDM and downtempo artists such as Boards of Canada, Bonobo and Trentemøller, but adds more accent on melody than on rhythm._

Well, pretty much literally like in my own press release I had sent them, haha. Sorry.

I appreciate the fact that you featured me, it was very kind.
