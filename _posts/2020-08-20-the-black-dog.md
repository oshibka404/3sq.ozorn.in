english techno band The Black Dog has recently released their album "Final Collected Vexations".

it's a good listening for those people who (just like me) want to get into techno music but hate listening to kick drum for ten minutes waiting for the snare part and then five more minutes waiting for another repetitive beep bloop.

the album definitely hasn't been created for raving in a dark club having swallowed tabs. it's for listening in headphones at home, being alone. preferrably, doing something else along with listening.

they're doing it for over 30 years already, can you imagine?
