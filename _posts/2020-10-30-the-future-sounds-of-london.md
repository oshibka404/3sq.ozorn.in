The Future Sound Of London are still dinstinctive in the richness of their sound palette.

in their earlier years, when they had made [Papua New Guinea] and [Lifeforms], there was a legend that no sound is used twice in their music.
 even though it's bullshit, their sounds are so diverse that this bullshit seems very plausible.

the new album combines brand new compositions with recreated versions of tracks from 1993's release [Cascade].
 all of them sound nostalgic with unhideable intention of being futuristic.

worth listening but don't expect it to be a revelation like their first releases used to be.
