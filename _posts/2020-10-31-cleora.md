slowly morphing ambient soundscapes to be played in background.

the music has no disturbing or unexpected loud noises making it a good choice to play it while reading a book or writing this blog post.

the samples are finely selected and overall impression is above average, but nothing really new compared to B. Eno or The Future Sound Of London
