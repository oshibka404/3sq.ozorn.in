## EP1

My first mini-album EP1 is a 17 minute journey through five feelings: it goes from self-doubt and anxiety of "Weird Strangers" through pure happiness of "Bright" 
to melancholic pacification of "The Walk in Falling Leaves", which is my personal favorite one.

Yes, it is free for download from Bandcamp because I consider it the right thing to do, and, let's be honest, because I have a job.
